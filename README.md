# Eat Da Burger

## Overview 
This app is a "burger logger" which utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and my own ORM.  It is built following the MVC design pattern and deployed to Heroku

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat Me!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not in a MySQL database hosted with Heroku.

The following NPM Packages are installed to run this app:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

### Eat Da Burger Site Walkthrough

The home page has a welcome message "Welcome to Lil' Angus' Burger Shack". There is a dancing burger gif to represent Lil'Angus.  The user is instructed to type their order into an input area and then "place" the order by clicking the button that says "Click here to place order" Under that there are several burgers ready to be devoured.  When the user clicks the "Eat Me!" button the burgers will then be placed into the "Eaten Burgers" section and there is a message that states "We are sold out of these burgers" Come back another time!"

## What needs to be completed to finish this project

As of 11/5/2018, I am still working on getting my buttons to function.  I need to figure out how to format the requests to tie into my handlebars page.  My styling is leaving something to be desired, so I need to work on centering, and making the flow better.
